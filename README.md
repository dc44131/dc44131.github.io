Based in Edinburgh and its surroundings, we aim to promote networking and information sharing between technology interested people.

Our main focus is Information Security. However, given our varied background and fields of interest, almost every technological aspect of modern life is up for discussion.

Everyone is welcome! Between seasoned professionals, proactive students, hardcore hobbyists, wise professors we should be able to discuss a wide array of useful and interesting ideas!

With an informal stance, meetings will take place at a pub. They should happen every other month, on the month's first Tuesday, unless stated otherwise.

Entrance is free and limited only by physical constraints (i.e. if the room is full). ;)
